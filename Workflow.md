# Workflow

* After I reviewed the task, I decided to built it with vanilla Js and with express Js as the backend server.
* First I installed the server with node.js's package manager, and installed the necessary dependences.
* I made a sample csv file from the task's example.
* After that I put the csv's content to an endpoint ("/csv") so I can process it from the frontend-side.
* In the frontend folder, after I built the basic structures, I began to work on the GET request.
* After done, I built an algorithm that iterates through the data.
* And finally I made a simple UI for it with the help of Bootstrap and scss.
